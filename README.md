## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript ES6+
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I aimed to find a robust solution using Vanilla JS to push my boundaries in a demanding front-end application.

I'll' keep refactoring this code and I'll try to add some new features.

I successfully tackled the issue of instances of '<' in the text, ensuring they were not interpreted as HTML tags by using `replace(/</g, "&lt;")`

At first, I was uncertain about how to approach the problem since I am currently studying Regex and needed to conduct research. I am pleased with the final outcome.

```js
answers.forEach((o, i) => {
  // prettier-ignore
  const answerMarkup = `
      <li class="subjects__subject" data-answer="${o.replace(/</g,"&lt;")}" tabindex="0">
        <p class="subject-icon">${String.fromCharCode(65 + i)}</p>
        <p class="subject-text">${o.replace(/</g, "&lt;")}</p>
      </li>
    `;

  answerContainer.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", answerMarkup);
});
```

### Continued development

I want to use this project as a benchmark to remake it in React, both to master it and to add some new features.
